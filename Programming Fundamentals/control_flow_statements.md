# Control Flow Statements

## Course Overview:

This course covers the fundamental control flow statements in Python that are used to control the execution of code. Through a series of lectures and coding exercises, students will learn the basic control flow statements in Python, such as if/else statements, for loops, and while loops, and how to use them effectively in their code.

## Course Outline:

- Introduction to Control Flow Statements
  - What are control flow statements?
  - Why are they important in programming?
  - Overview of the basic control flow statements in Python
- Conditional Statements: if/else statements
  - Basic syntax and structure of if/else statements
  - Comparison operators and boolean values
  - Nesting if/else statements
  - The elif statement
- Loops: for loops and while loops
  - Basic syntax and structure of for loops and while loops
  - Using loops to iterate over sequences
  - The range() function and other loop control statements
  - Nesting loops and using loops with if/else statements
- Advanced Control Flow: break, continue, and pass statements
  - The break statement for exiting loops prematurely
  - The continue statement for skipping to the next iteration of a loop
  - The pass statement for placeholder code
- Final Project
  - Putting it all together: a final project that demonstrates your knowledge of control flow statements in Python and your ability to write functional code.

By the end of the course, students will have a strong understanding of the basic control flow statements in Python, including if/else statements, for loops, and while loops. They will also be familiar with advanced control flow statements such as break, continue, and pass. Students will be able to use these statements effectively in their own Python code, and will have experience with applying control flow statements to solve practical programming problems.
